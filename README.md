Astrogea_local features a prototyipal, single case local analysis for the Astrogea library.
It is made of 4 different modules, with each of them performing tasks such as summary product (RGB maps) generation via GUI interaction,
spectra extraction from a RGB map via polygon drawing, spectra normalization either by neutral spectrum or convex hull and
spectral analysis via broad band analysis, dataset-based spectral comparison or modified gaussian machine learning driven models for spectral deconvolution.
